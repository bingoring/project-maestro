## Phase 1: Technical Foundation (30 minutes)

### 1.1 LangChain & LLM Fundamentals

**Q1: Explain the difference between LangChain's legacy AgentExecutor and modern LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) patterns.**

**Expected Answer:**
- Legacy AgentExecutor: Monolithic, less composable, limited streaming
- LCEL: Composable with pipe operators (`|`), streaming support, Runnable interface
- Modern patterns use `.invoke()`, `.stream()`, `.batch()` methods
- Better debugging and introspection capabilities

**Follow-up:** Can you provide an example of migrating from AgentExecutor to LCEL?

```python
# Legacy
agent = create_openai_functions_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools)
result = executor.invoke({"input": query})

# Modern LCEL
agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools, state_modifier=prompt)
result = agent.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage(content=query)]})
```

**Q2: What are the key components of a production-ready LLM application?**

**Expected Answer:**
- Model management and selection
- Prompt engineering and versioning
- Context management and RAG systems
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Cost monitoring and optimization
- Observability and logging
- Security and data privacy
- Performance optimization

### 1.2 Python & Async Programming

**Q3: Explain the differences between `asyncio.create_task()`, `asyncio.gather()`, and `asyncio.as_completed()`.**

**Expected Answer:**
- `create_task()`: Schedules coroutine for execution, returns Task object
- `gather()`: Runs multiple coroutines concurrently, preserves order
- `as_completed()`: Returns results as they complete, variable order

**Coding Exercise:** Write a function that processes multiple LLM requests concurrently with timeout handling.

```python
async def process_llm_requests(requests: List[str], timeout: int = 30) -> List[str]:
    async def process_single(request: str) -> str:
        try:
            return await asyncio.wait_for(llm.ainvoke(request), timeout=timeout)
        except asyncio.TimeoutError:
            return f"Request timed out: {request[:50]}"
    
    tasks = [process_single(req) for req in requests]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

## Phase 2: LangGraph & Multi-Agent Systems (45 minutes)

### 2.1 LangGraph Architecture

**Q4: Explain the core concepts of LangGraph and how it differs from traditional agent frameworks.**

**Expected Answer:**
- Graph-based execution model vs linear agent chains
- Stateful workflows with persistent state management
- Node-based agent architecture with explicit control flow
- Built-in checkpointing and memory management
- Support for complex routing and conditional execution
- Human-in-the-loop capabilities

**Q5: What is a `Command` object in LangGraph and when would you use it?**

**Expected Answer:**
```python
return Command(
    goto="target_node",           # Which node to execute next
    update={"key": "value"},      # State updates
    graph=Command.PARENT          # Graph navigation control
)
```

Used for:
- Agent handoffs and routing
- State management and updates
- Dynamic workflow control
- Cross-graph navigation

### 2.2 Multi-Agent Coordination

**Q6: Describe different multi-agent coordination patterns and their use cases.**

**Expected Answer:**

1. **Supervisor Pattern**
   - Central coordinator routes tasks
   - Use for: Complex decision making, resource allocation
   
2. **Swarm Pattern**
   - Agents hand off control dynamically
   - Use for: Flexible, adaptive workflows
   
3. **Hierarchical Pattern**
   - Multi-layer agent organization
   - Use for: Large-scale, structured workflows
   
4. **Pipeline Pattern**
   - Sequential agent execution
   - Use for: Data processing, transformation workflows

**Practical Exercise:** Design a multi-agent system for e-commerce order processing.

**Expected Design:**
```python
agents = {
    "order_validator": validate_order_details,
    "inventory_checker": check_stock_availability,
    "payment_processor": handle_payment,
    "fulfillment_coordinator": coordinate_shipping,
    "customer_notifier": send_notifications
}

# Workflow with conditional routing and error handling
```

### 2.3 State Management

**Q7: How would you design state management for a long-running, multi-session workflow?**

**Expected Answer:**
- Use persistent checkpointing (Redis/Database)
- Implement state schemas with TypedDict
- Handle state migrations and versioning
- Consider memory usage and cleanup
- Implement state validation and recovery

**Code Example:**
```python
class WorkflowState(TypedDict):
    session_id: str
    current_stage: str
    data: Dict[str, Any]
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
    
# Checkpointing strategy
checkpointer = RedisSaver(connection=redis_client)
graph = graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
```

- Monitoring and auto-scaling
- Circuit breakers and timeout handling

**Discussion Points:**
- Database sharding strategies

### 3.2 RAG System Integration

**Q9: How would you integrate a RAG system with multi-agent workflows?**

**Expected Answer:**
- Agent-specific knowledge bases
- Context sharing between agents
- Dynamic retrieval based on agent specialization
- Vector store management and updates
- Relevance scoring and filtering
- Memory management for long contexts

**Implementation Considerations:**
```python
class AgentRAGSystem:
    def __init__(self, agent_name: str):
        self.vector_store = self.get_agent_specific_store(agent_name)
        self.retriever = self.vector_store.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 5})
    
    async def get_context(self, query: str, agent_context: Dict) -> List[Document]:
        # Agent-specific retrieval logic
        pass
```

### 3.3 Error Handling & Resilience

**Q10: Design an error handling strategy for multi-agent workflows where agent failures can cascade.**

**Expected Strategy:**
- Circuit breaker pattern for agent failures
